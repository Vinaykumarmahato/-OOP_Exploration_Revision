         * capital Thats why here syntax error will be.

         * 
         * (Logical Error)

         * In Logical Error Syntax error will not be there everything will be fine but
         * the problem will be like your Except result will not be visible.

         * 
         * Here Logical error will be occur because you are saying the addition of two
         * number but Logically you have written the '-' which will give you a Logical
         * error.
         * 
         * (Run Time Error)
         * 
         * This is the error everything will Looks fine but when we will execute the
         * code it will give the error that is called Run Time Error
        
        int Num1 = 5;
        int Num2 = 0; Due to it this will give you an error and we should handle it.

        System.out.println("Division :" + Num3);
        System.out.println("Bye");
