# 🚀 Exception Handling Examples

This GitHub repository contains several Java programs illustrating different aspects of exception handling. Each file in the "Exception Handling" folder serves a specific purpose, as outlined below:

## 📚 CheckedAndUnCheckedException.java

This Java program demonstrates the concepts of Checked and Unchecked Exceptions. It includes examples of both types of exceptions, providing comments to explain the differences and how to handle them.

## 🎯 CustomExceptionAndThrowKeyWord.java

This file introduces the concept of creating custom exceptions by extending the standard `Exception` class. It demonstrates how to throw and catch custom exceptions using the `throw` keyword.

## 📝 ExceptionExplanation.java

This Java file serves as an explanation and reference for exception handling concepts. It contains comments that detail the key points related to exception handling, including checked and unchecked exceptions, the hierarchy of exceptions, and how to handle them in Java.

## ⚙️ ExceptionHandling1.java

This Java program covers the basics of exception handling, showcasing try-catch blocks and the handling of specific exceptions. It includes examples to demonstrate how to gracefully manage exceptions in various scenarios.

## 🤔 HandlingVsDuckingException.java

In this Java file, the program illustrates the difference between handling and ducking exceptions. It shows how exceptions can be caught and dealt with or ignored, allowing them to propagate further.

## 🔄 TryFinallyAndTryWithResources.java

The program in this file explores the usage of the `finally` block in exception handling. It demonstrates how to use the `finally` block to ensure certain actions are taken, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

## 🎭 TryWithMultipleCatchBlock.java

This Java file introduces the concept of handling multiple exceptions using multiple catch blocks. It shows how to catch and handle different types of exceptions within the same try-catch structure.

## 🌐 TryWithResourceNewFeature.java

This program demonstrates the newer try-with-resources feature introduced in Java. It allows for automatic resource management by automatically closing resources like files, making the code cleaner and more concise.
