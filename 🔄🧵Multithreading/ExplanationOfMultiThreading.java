        // This Java program serves as an outline for understanding concepts related to Multi-Threading.

        // Operating System:
        // - The core software that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs.
        // - Responsible for task scheduling and managing resources like memory and CPU.

        // Tasking and MultiTasking:
        // - Tasking: Executing one task at a time.
        // - MultiTasking: Simultaneously executing multiple tasks.

        // Process:
        // - An independent program with its own memory space and resources.
        // - Processes in the OS can run concurrently.

        // Threads:
        // - Lightweight, smaller units within a process.
        // - Threads share the same resources but have their own execution path.
        // - Threads in a process can run concurrently.

        // How to create a thread:
        // - In Java, you can create a thread by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.

        // run() Method:
        // - The entry point for the execution of a thread.
        // - Contains the code that will be executed by the thread.

        // Multiple Tasks Within Single run() Method:
        // - A thread can perform multiple tasks within its run() method.

        // Different States of Thread:
        // - Threads can be in various states like new, runnable, blocked, waiting, timed waiting, and terminated.

        // Synchronized Keyword:
        // - Used to control access to critical sections of code by multiple threads.
        // - Prevents multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously.

        // Deadlock:
        // - A situation where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a lock.

        // Producer-Consumer Problem:
        // - A classical problem where two processes, the producer and the consumer, share a common, fixed-size buffer as a queue.

        // This program currently serves as a placeholder and doesn't demonstrate the mentioned concepts.
